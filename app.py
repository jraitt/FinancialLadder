    ### Bond Ladder Concept
    
    A bond ladder is an investment strategy where you purchase bonds with staggered maturity dates. 
    Instead of buying a single bond that matures in, say, 10 years, you might buy several bonds that 
    mature in 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 years.
    
    ### Key Benefits
    
    1. **Reduced Interest Rate Risk**: By spreading investments across different maturities, you reduce 
       the impact of interest rate fluctuations.
    
    2. **Liquidity Management**: As bonds mature at regular intervals, you have the flexibility to 
       either reinvest or use the proceeds.
    
    3. **Income Stability**: The ladder provides a consistent stream of income as different bonds mature.
    
    4. **Diversification**: Using different types of bond funds adds another layer of diversification.
    
    ### How This Tool Works
    
    This tool helps you allocate your investment across various bond funds with different maturity ranges 
    to create an effective bond ladder. If you choose age adjustment, the allocation will be tailored to 
    be more conservative as your age increases.
