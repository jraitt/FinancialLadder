    st.markdown("""
    ### Bond Quality
    
    Bond quality, often referred to as credit quality, indicates the likelihood that a bond issuer will 
    default on its debt obligations. Bonds are typically rated by credit rating agencies (e.g., Moody's, 
    Standard & Poor's) from highest (e.g., AAA) to lowest (e.g., D).
    
    -   **Investment Grade Bonds**: These are bonds issued by financially stable entities with a low 
        risk of default. They typically offer lower yields but are considered safer.
    -   **High-Yield (Junk) Bonds**: These are bonds issued by companies or governments with a higher 
        risk of default. They offer higher yields to compensate investors for the increased risk.
    
    ### Bond Maturity and Interest Rate Sensitivity
    
    **Maturity** refers to the length of time until the bond's principal is repaid to the investor. 
    Bonds can have short-term (e.g., less than 3 years), intermediate-term (e.g., 3-10 years), or 
    long-term (e.g., over 10 years) maturities.
    
    **Interest Rate Sensitivity** (or duration) describes how much a bond's price is likely to change 
    when interest rates move.
    
    -   **Inverse Relationship**: Bond prices and interest rates generally move in opposite directions. 
        When interest rates rise, existing bond prices fall (and vice-versa).
    -   **Longer Maturity = Higher Sensitivity**: Bonds with longer maturities are more sensitive to 
        changes in interest rates. A small change in interest rates will have a larger impact on the 
        price of a long-term bond than on a short-term bond.
    
    ### Bonds vs. Stocks: Historical Relationship
    
    Historically, bonds and stocks have often exhibited a low or negative correlation, meaning they tend 
    to move in different directions or have less synchronized movements.
    
    -   **Diversification**: This low correlation makes bonds a valuable diversification tool in a 
        portfolio. When stocks perform poorly, bonds may hold their value or even increase, providing 
        a cushion against overall portfolio losses.
    -   **Risk and Return**: Stocks generally offer higher potential returns over the long term but come 
        with higher volatility and risk. Bonds typically offer lower, more stable returns with less 
        volatility, making them suitable for capital preservation and income generation.
